# Fin Trax
By team **run as a cat** as a part of submission for **Level-Up Society** hackathon by showcodes

## Introduction
Setting an actionable financial goal is hard, not to mention reaching it. This is often because tracking the progress is difficult in long term and it is hard to see the immediate effects/hard work is not appreciated.

## What Fin Trax does
A money saving app with roadmap functionality to give the users a visual representation of their progress towards their financial goals and, based off user variables, how much they need/can save to reach that goal.

## How we built Fin Trax
We started with brainstorming several ideas. We decided to work on a developing a roadmap to achieve a financial goal.
Tech Stack
- React Native
- Expo CLI
- Figma for prototyping
- Jira for task management


## Challenges we have faced
- Time contraints and we are team from all over the worls, the timezone difference made it a little more harder for us
- varying levels of compatibility in developing environment 
- React-Native is a relatively unfamiliar tool 

## What's next for Fin Trax
- have a functional database and query the base to construct a live leaderboard
- Adding more themes according to the goal
